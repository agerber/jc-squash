A lone title came in 2012 before the Egyptian had to wait over two years for his next piece of silverware at the PSA International Championship which was his maiden PSA M25 title.\n" +

                    "Farag had a tremendous 2015 and appeared in four PSA World Tour finals, winning three of them. His final title, at the Irish Open, was the most prestigious of the lot. He also had a superb run at the World Championship in November 2015 with fine wins over Max Lee and Simon Rösner being particular highlights. He eventually bowed out at the quarter-final stage to eventual winner Gregory Gaultier.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Farag broke new ground at the Motor City Open in January 2016, beating then World No.1 Mohamed ElShorbagy and three-time World Champion Nick Matthew en route to a maiden PSA M70 title. A semi-final finish at the Grasshopper Cup and a last eight placing at the El Gouna International on home soil rounded off the 2015/16 season for Farag, who was rewarded with a move in to the world’s top 10 in May, before the end-of-season PSA Awards saw him rewarded with both the Fan’s Player of the Season and Spirit of Squash awards.\n" +

                    "Farag built on his breakout 2015/16 season by claiming one of the biggest wins of his career against Mohamed ElShorbagy to reach the final of the Al Ahram Open – played in front of the stunning Great Pyramid of Giza – but lost out to fellow Egyptian Karim Abdel Gawad in the final. He made it to the 2016 Al Ahram Squash Open Newgiza final but lost 3-0 to then-World No.1 Karim Abdel Gawad.\n" +

His next three tournaments ended at the hands of the World No.1, losing in the final to ElShorbagy in both the Channel VAS Championships and the Hong Kong Open. The Egyptian then won the Swedish Open, before finishing runner-up at the El Gouna International, losing out to Elshorbagy again, but this time, it was Marwan.\n" +

In doing so, Elias became the first Peruvian to win a PSA World Tour title.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Three months later he claimed the distinction of becoming the first Peruvian to become the World Junior Champion after he failed to drop a single game during the event and defeated Omar Elatmas in the final. The following month he doubled his PSA World Tour title tally as he lifted the Salt Lake City Open and in December 2014 he broke the world’s top 50.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "He captured his first ever PSA M15 crown at the Costa Rica Open with a straight games win over Alan Clyne in the final in June 2015 to cap an excellent 2014/15 season for the teenage sensation. Elias started the 2015/16 season with a succession of quarter-final finishes. He then made the semi-final at the Netsuite Open where England’s James Willstrop got the better of him to make it through to the final.\n" +

                    "The Peruvian went on to make the semi-final but fell to defeat against Ryan Cuskelly at the Harrow Charlottesville Open in 2016, before going on to make the final the following week at the Nash Cup, where Declan James edged him over a gruelling five-games. However, Elias did go on to claim his own title, this time coming out on top at the Reidbuilt Homes Edmonton Open in 2016, beating Cesar Salazar. This was followed by two semi-final appearances at the Suburban Collection Motor City Open and Holtrand Open in 2017.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The 2017/18 season started well for the Peruvian Puma, as he reached the semi finals of the Oracle NetSuite Open. He then reached the same stage of the Channel VAS Championships the next month. Elias then made it to the final of the Sporta Guatemala XI Torneo Internacional PSA 2018, where he was defeated by fellow South American, Miguel Rodriguez.\n" +

                    "He was part of the Peruvian team that won the doubles at the South American Games, as well as winning the singles himself. Elias then also won the Pan American Championship as well. The Peruvian made another appearances in the semis of the Channel VAS Championships in 2018, before reaching the same stage of the Qatar Classic.

                    "The Alexandria-born star rose to prominence in 2007 after he became the first player in history to secure a maiden PSA World Tour title at a five star event. He then entered the record books again soon after, becoming only the second man after Ramy Ashour to win the World Junior Championship twice when he triumphed in 2008 and 2009.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The Egyptian came close to winning the senior World Championship in 2012 after besting James Willstrop in a five-game semi-final thriller but lost out to compatriot Ashour in the final. In 2013 he claimed his first World Series win in the Qatar Classic and exhibited some supreme form throughout the 2014 campaign, winning five events including World Series tournaments at the Hong Kong and US Opens.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The latter in particular was significant because it elevated ElShorbagy to World No.1 for the first time in his career, courtesy of his victory over Gregory Gaultier in the semi-final, becoming the fourth youngest player to reach the milestone. He lost a second World Championship final, against compatriot Ashour, during the 2014 tournament in Qatar in what was dubbed one of the greatest squash matches ever.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The Egyptian recovered from his World Championship heartbreak to lift the Tournament of Champions title in January 2015 and, after finishing runner-up at both the Windy City Open and the El Gouna International, he won the British Open for the first time in his career, beating Gaultier in the final. ElShorbagy lifted the British Grand Prix title in September 2015 before celebrating 12 months at the summit of the World Rankings the following month.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "After claiming another PSA World Series triumph at the Qatar Classic in November, he dropped out of the World Championship at third round stage after a shock exit to James Willstrop as his search for the sport’s biggest prize continued. However, a spell-binding run of form from December 2015 to April 2016 saw ElShorbagy dominate the PSA World Tour, bringing him up to six successive World Series title wins, including defending his crown at the British Open after ending a four-match winless run against Ashour.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "During that period, ElShorbagy also broke Ashour’s record for the highest ever World Rankings points average in April, a record he then shattered again a month later. A superb season was rounded off in style when he was crowned the 2016 PSA Men’s Player of the Year.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "ElShorbagy started the 2016/17 season fairly strongly with another victory at the U.S. Open, but he missed out on becoming the first player to win the Qatar Classic on three successive occasions after a final defeat to compatriot Karim Abdel Gawad – just a month after Gawad had beaten him in the World Championship semi-final."

That was followed by his first major title, as he came from behind to defeat Tarek Momen in the final of the U.S. Open presented by Truist. Those results, along with several other semi-final appearances, saw him break into the top five of the World Rankings for the first time.\n" +

Coll’s breakthrough moment came in December’s Channel VAS Championship in Weybridge, where he battled through from qualification to lift his first PSA M100 title – upsetting established top 20 players such as Max Lee, Miguel Angel Rodriguez, Daryl Selby and, finally, Tarek Momen to claim his place among them in the January rankings.\n" +

Her first Tour title came a year later at the Creteil International Open where she became the third youngest Tour title winner after besting home favourite Camille Serme in the final.\n\n" +
                    "She finished 2010 in the world’s top 20 players while April 2011 brought her second Tour title as she powered past former World Champion Vanessa Atkinson en-route to the Irish Open crown. The Egyptian captured the Atlantis Open in 2012 while 2014 saw her reach successive World Series finals at the Malaysian Open and Hong Kong Open tournaments but she fell to Raneem El Welily and Nicol David, respectively.\n\n" +
                    "She made it to the final of the Texas Open in April 2015 but was defeated by Amanda Sobhy at the final hurdle. A fine run at the US Open seven months later almost paid dividends after she shocked then World No.1 El Welily but she narrowly fell to a final defeat against Laura Massaro.\n\n" +
                    "An injury sustained during her match with El Welily resulted in an enforced six-month spell on the sidelines for El Tayeb, who spent much of 2016 trying to force her way back into the world’s top 10. El Tayeb made her return from injury in the Naza PSA Women’s World Championship in 2015, where she exited at round 2 against Amanda Sobhy in a gruelling five-game encounter.\n\n" +
                    "The Egyptian went onto make a semi-final appearance in the Al Ahram Squash Open, where she was beaten by Nour El Sherbini over three games. She continued to make her recovery throughout 2017, making it back to the victory circle at the US Open in Philadelphia, where she defeated Raneem El Welily. Along with husband Ali Farag, the pair became the first married couple to win the same major sports title on the same day.\n\n" +
                    "She reached the semi finals of the World Championships at the end of the year, before making the final of the Tournament of Champions in early 2018. February was a good month for El Tayeb, who won both the Egyptian National Championship and the Windy City Open. With those performances, she moved up to No.3 in the World Rankings.\n\n" +
                    "El Tayeb then also won the Carol Weymuller Open at the back end of 2018, before reaching the semi finals of the Tournament of Champions. The Egyptian then continued her good form in the States by winning the Cleveland Classic.\n\n" +
                    "She then reached the final of the PSA World Championships for the first time in her career, but lost out to compatriot Nour El Sherbini in the final. El Tayeb also has semi final appearances at the DPD Open, Manchester Open and British Open in 2019.\n\n" +
                    "The ‘Black Widow’ began the 2019-20 campaign in the best possible way, as she got the better of World No.1 Raneem El Welily to win the J.P. Morgan China Squash Open in September. She then made the final of the Oracle NetSuite Open in San Francisco three weeks later, but the 2017 World Champion exacted her revenge.\n\n" +
                    "El Tayeb reached a third straight final to begin the season, making it to the showpiece finale at the FS Investments U.S. Open Squash Championships in Philadelphia, but she lost out to Nouran Gohar on the day. She suffered the same fate at the Bronze level Carol Weymuller Open in January, before going on to win the Cleveland Classic, defeating Sarah-Jane Perry in the final, to take her second crown of the term."

                    "She has shown herself to be an adept competitor at junior events with the German Junior U19 Open, the European Junior U19 Championship and the Pioneer Junior U19 Cup all going to the youngster in 2014. Gilis narrowly missed out on both the London Open and Edinburgh Open titles in 2014 and 2015, losing out to Yathreb Adel and Fiona Moverley, respectively.\n\n" +
                    "In 2016 Gilis marched to the final of the Paderborn Open, falling short of clinching the title as Nada Abbas sealed the victory over three games. The Belgian then went one better at the Open International Des Volcans sealing victory with a 3-1 win over Amanda Landers-Murphy leading her to break into the world’s top 40 for the first time that year.\n\n" +
                    "The next year Gilis continued her strong form with a win in the final of the Irish Open over five games against England’s Millie Tomlinson.

                    "Gilis then followed that up by reaching the last eight of a Platinum event for the first time in her career, doing so at the British Open. With that result, she moved into the top 20 in the World Rankings for the first time. She took another step up the World Rankings at the end of the 2019-2020 season, breaking into the top 16 for the first time in her career.\n\n" +
                    "That came about after consistently reaching the last 16 of major tournaments, the Belgian No.1 doing so at the Open de France – Nantes, Oracle NetSuite Open, Windy City Open and Black Ball Women’s Open. Gilis went one stage further at the Bahl and Gaynor Cincinnati Cup, along with reaching the final of the Detroit Pro Classic, where she lost out to Olivia Clyne in the final."

                    "Kennedy returned in June 2021, and went on to win seven of her first nine tournaments, including three Challenger 10 level tournaments, doing so at the Berkhamsted Linksap Open, TWC Squash Squared Open and the Springfield Scottish Squash Open. She also made it to the final of the Squash On Fire Open in that period.\n\n" +

                    "After a runner-up finish at the Remeo Ladies Open, her last tournament of 2018, Fiechter then made the quarter finals of five of her next six tournaments, before finishing runner-up at the Richmond Open.\n\n" +
